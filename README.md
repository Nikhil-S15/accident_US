# accident_US

For this project, I have chosen the US Accidents Dataset, a comprehensive dataset that provides detailed information about car accidents in the United States. This dataset is publicly available and has been widely used for research purposes in the field of transportation safety. It contains rich attributes such as accident location, weather conditions, time of occurrence, severity level, and road features, making it ideal for an in-depth analysis of accident patterns and factors.

The dataset focuses specifically on car accidents, aligning perfectly with the project's goal of understanding accident severity and its determinants.
With over a million records and numerous features, this dataset provides a robust foundation for exploratory analysis and predictive modeling.
It has been collected and maintained with high standards, ensuring reliable and accurate insights.

### Primary Objectives:
- To analyze the factors contributing to car accidents, including environmental, temporal, and roadway characteristics.
- To identify patterns and key determinants of accident severity.
- To build a predictive model capable of classifying accident severity based on relevant features.
- To propose actionable recommendations for improving road safety and reducing accident severity.

### Workplan:
1. **Data Understanding and Preparation**  
   - **Data Cleaning:** Address missing values, inconsistent formats, and outliers to ensure data quality.  
   - **Feature Engineering:** Derive new features (e.g., time-of-day categories, weather severity index) to enrich the dataset.  
   - **Explore the Dataset:** Understand the features, distributions, and any anomalies.

2. **Analysis and Insights**  
   - **Univariate and Bivariate Analysis:** Examine individual features and their relationships with accident severity.  
   - **Temporal Analysis:** Identify accident hotspots and seasonal trends.  

3. **Predictive Modeling**  
   - Train multiple machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM) to predict accident severity.  
   - **Model Evaluation:** Compare model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.  
   - **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimize the best-performing model for enhanced accuracy.

4. **Communication of Results**  
   - Present actionable insights and propose recommendations for improving road safety.
